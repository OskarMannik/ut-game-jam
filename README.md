**Goal:**
Reach the bottom platform safely while collecting as many items as possible to increase score.

**Controls:**
*   **W/Up Arrow:** Move Forward
*   **S/Down Arrow:** Move Backward
*   **A/Left Arrow:** Turn Left
*   **D/Right Arrow:** Turn Right
*   **Spacebar:** Jump


**Gameplay:**
*   **Scoring:** Your score is based on how quickly you descend, plus points for each Artifact (+1000) and Memory (+750) collected. Reaching the end gives a bonus.
*   **High Jump:** Collecting your first Artifact unlocks a higher jump ability.
*   **Falling:** Be careful! Missing a platform and falling causes damage. Falling past more than one platform in a single jump will kill you and reset your current attempt.

*   **Map Regeneration:** The level layout regenerates every 5 minutes.
